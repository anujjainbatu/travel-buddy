# Travel Buddy

Welcome to Travel Buddy! This project is just starting and we are looking for collaborators. Together, we can build an amazing tool to simplify the app discovery and installation process for travelers.

## Project Overview

Travelers visiting a foreign country often face challenges in identifying and downloading essential apps that cater to their basic needs (e.g., transportation, language translation, currency conversion) or specific requirements (e.g., productivity, entertainment, health). Manually searching for and downloading these apps can be time-consuming and overwhelming, especially when unfamiliar with local app recommendations.

To address this, we are developing a centralized website that:
- Provides curated lists of recommended apps for travelers, categorized into **basic needs** and **specific requirements** (e.g., productivity, communication, etc.).
- Allows users to select apps from these categories to create a personalized list.
- Generates a QR code for the selected apps, which, when scanned, automatically initiates the download of all chosen apps from the respective app stores (Google Play Store, Apple App Store, etc.).

This solution aims to simplify the app discovery and installation process for travelers, ensuring they have access to the necessary tools for a seamless travel experience.
